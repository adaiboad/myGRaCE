            <ThirdNote>Whenever a negative thought/memory appears, look at your diary for positive ones to redirect those memories.Do not sit there a let those memories dwell. Do not go to sleep at night with those bad thought, fill them with positive ones
    before you sleep at night.</ThirdNote>
